# Basic MATLAB Image Processing Operations

## Purpose
To perform basic image processing operations in MATLAB such as matrix generation, image display, grayscale conversion, color channel extraction, and binary image creation.

---

## Code Used
```matlab
clc
close all
clear all

% Matrix Generation
I = uint8(rand(8,8) * 255);
disp(I);
imshow(I);

% Image to Grayscale
Image = imread('Image.jpg');
imshow(Image);
figure();
Image_Gray = rgb2gray(Image);
imshow(Image_Gray);

% Red Channel Extraction
Image_Red = Image;
figure();
Image_Red(:,:,2) = 0;
Image_Red(:,:,3) = 0;
imshow(Image_Red);

% Black and White Conversion
B_W = Image_Gray > 50;
uint8(B_W);
figure();
imshow(B_W);
Operations Performed

Clears command window, workspace, and closes figures

Generates a random matrix and displays it as an image

Reads and displays an RGB image

Converts RGB image to grayscale

Extracts and displays the red color component

Converts grayscale image to black and white using thresholding

Output

Random grayscale matrix image

Original RGB image

Grayscale image

Red-channel image

Binary black and white image

The program demonstrates fundamental MATLAB image processing operations and shows how images can be manipulated using simple matrix-based techniques.
